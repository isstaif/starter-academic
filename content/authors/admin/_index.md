Iâ€™m a first year PhD student in the Systems Research Group (SRG) at the Department of Computer Science and Technology (The Computer Laboratory), under the supervision of Prof. Richard Mortier. I am a member of Clare College. 

The focus of my research is on building self-scaling network services on next generation infrastructure (IoT/5G/edge), leveraging lightweight virtualization techniques and distributed tracing.
