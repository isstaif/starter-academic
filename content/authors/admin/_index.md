I am a first year PhD student in the [Systems Research Group (SRG)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/) at the Department of Computer Science and Technology (also known as "The Computer Lab"), working under the supervision of Professor [Richard Mortier](https://mort.io/). I am a member of [Clare College](http://www.clare.cam.ac.uk/Home/). 

The focus of my research is on building self-scaling network services on top of next generation infrastructure (IoT/5G/edge), leveraging lightweight virtualization techniques and distributed tracing. My work falls under the [Compute First Networking](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/projects/cfn/) research project, which is a collaboration between Huawei, BT, and the SRG.

In 2018, I was awarded the [Said Foundation Cambridge Scholarship ](https://www.cambridgetrust.org/partners/said-foundation), to study the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science (ACS). Before joining the Computer Lab, I co-founded several projects for empowering engineering students in Syria, including the award-winning education enterprise: [Wikilogia](https://wikilogia.org/en). 

I am interested in the convergence of the IT and teclcom worlds, as well as the the role of the cloud-native and open source movements in shaping the future of cloud and network infrastructure. I have deep passion for social entrepreneurship and the role of digital infrastructure in addressing development and sustainablity challenges across the globe.
