abstract: Next generation service-based systems will become increasingly finer-grain, larger-scale with heterogeneous performance characteristics. These services will need to be orchestrated across multiple IT infrastructures with applicationspecific auto-scaling capabilities to self-adapt to workload and environment changes. Today's generic autoscalers fail to address the adaptation needs of such systems and current methods for developing effectively application-aware autoscalers require substantial efforts and are far from practical. In this PhD project, I propose that distributed tracing alongside library operating systems (unikernels) can provide a cost-effective alternative approach to build self-scaling services. Such services will embody their own auto-scaling systems that are both generic and application-aware.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A position paper highlighting the key ideas behind the general approach of my PhD proposal which is based on the combination of distributed tracing and unikernels. In particular, I explain the importance of distributed for reactive autoscaling, and the unique architecture of unikernels in the spectrum of lightweight virtualization techniques.
